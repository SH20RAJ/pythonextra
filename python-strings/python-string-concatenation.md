# Python - String Concatenation

In Python, you can concatenate, or combine, two strings by using the `+` operator. This allows you to join strings together to create a single, longer string.

#### Example

To merge the content of `a` and `b` into a new variable `c`:

```python
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)  # This will print "HelloWorld"
```

#### Adding a Space

If you want to add a space between the two strings, you can include a space within the quotes:

```python
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)  # This will print "Hello World"
```

String concatenation is a fundamental operation when working with text data, and it allows you to build more complex strings by combining simpler ones.
